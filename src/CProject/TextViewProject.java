        Achieved design principles:
        design principle 1: encapsulate classes that differs from other.
        design principle 2: program to an interface, not an implementation
        design principle 3: favor composition over inheritance
        design principle 4: loosely coupled design between objects that interact
        design principle 5: classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
